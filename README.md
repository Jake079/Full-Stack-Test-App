# Full-Stack-Test-App

A web app where you can create your own account and then save, edit or delete notes. There's a floating moon on the page that looks at your mouse cursor at all times using the Atan2 function. I use HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend and Python Flask for the backend. Simply run the code on main.py and you're good to GO!
